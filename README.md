# slox

Following along with [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), in Swift.

## Building & Running

- `swift run slox` to run REPL
- `swift run slox path/to/script.lox` to run script
- `swift run genslox` to regenerate code

# To Do

To make this language more my own, I'd like to change a few things about Lox.

- [ ] remove nil
- [ ] remove semicolons
- [ ] add +=, -=, /=, *= operators
